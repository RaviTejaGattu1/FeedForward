# FeedForward

Welcome to FeedForward, a full-stack web application designed to combat food waste and alleviate hunger by creating a direct link between food providers with surplus and recipients in need.

The platform serves as a community-driven marketplace where providers can easily list available food items, and recipients can find and reserve them. By leveraging modern web technologies and artificial intelligence, FeedForward aims to make food donation efficient, accessible, and impactful.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Provider & Recipient Roles:** A two-sided platform serving both those who want to provide food and those who are looking for it.
- **Secure User Authentication:** A mock authentication system allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
- **Dynamic Food Listings:** Providers can create, edit, and delete food listings, complete with images, quantity, weight/volume, and pickup address.
- **Geo-Location Search:** Recipients can search for available food listings based on their current location and a specified range (in miles or kilometers).
- **Interactive Map & Directions:** The platform uses the Google Maps API to show pickup locations and generate driving directions for recipients.
- **Reservation & Approval Flow:** Recipients can reserve a listing, which sends a real-time notification to the provider to approve or deny the request.
- **Secure Pickup System:**
  - **OTP Verification:** A one-time password is generated for secure, confirmed handoffs.
  - **Instruction-Based Pickup:** Providers can choose to leave the item in a safe location with specific instructions for the recipient.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** In-app dialogs notify providers instantly of new reservation requests.
- **AI-Powered Recipe Suggestions:** To help recipients make the most of their food, an AI assistant (powered by Google's Gemini model via Genkit) suggests simple recipes based on the donated food item. The suggestions are automatically proofread by another AI call to ensure quality.
- **Persistent State:** The application uses browser Local Storage to simulate a real-time database, persisting all user data, listings, and application state across sessions and browser tabs.

    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your Google Maps and Gemini API keys. You can get a Gemini key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

    ```.env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

    *Note: The Google Maps API key should have the **Maps JavaScript API**, **Places API**, **Geocoding API**, and **Directions API** enabled.*
